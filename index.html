          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>I'm a beginner, I've studied the basics of C and C++ over the past two years, I've taken a lot of courses and I'm studying at the faculty with a programming bias. 
            I like this field of activity. 
            I'm ready to spend time studying and searching for information I don't know. My goal is to study programming languages for further successful employment, because in today's world of knowledge in it the field is highly appreciated and 
            I believe that in the future it will be very useful to me. It is very important for me to study popular and demanded languages in order to be a specialist for whom there will always be demand.</p>
